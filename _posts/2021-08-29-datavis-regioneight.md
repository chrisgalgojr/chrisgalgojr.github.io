The 2022 election is fast approaching and with that comes the pressure of making sure that 
everybody eligible will be able to exercise their right to suffrage. As of writing, we only 
have exactly one month before the last day of voter's registration which is September 31, 2021. 
So if you have not registered I would like to direct you to some resources that may guide you to 
do so which you can find in the bottom of this blog.

With that in mind, we deemed it necessary and fitting to explore available data from Commission on 
Elections for our #datavis exercise of the week to see some interesting quick stats.
