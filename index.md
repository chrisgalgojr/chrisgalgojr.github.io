Hi, I'm Christopher. Currently, I am busy as a research assistant/ PhD researcher for the BEATLES project at Wageningen University and Research, a project funded by Horizon Europe which aims to propose innovative, systemic solutions to encourage long-term & large-scale transitions to sustainable, productive & climate smart agri-food systems.

When I have free time, I like to read, dance, listen to music, do karaoke and run.
