Hi, I'm Christopher. I am a research assistant/ PhD researcher at Wageningen University and Research. Currently, I am busy with activities related to the BEATLES, a project funded by Horizon Europe, which aims to propose innovative systemic solutions to encourage long-term and large-scale transitions to sustainable, productive, and climate smart agri-food systems.

In my free time, I like to read, dance, listen to music, do karaoke and run.
