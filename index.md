Hi, I'm a faculty member of the Institute for Strategic Research and Development Studies at the Visayas State University in the Philippines. I am interested in the role of data in education, rural development processes  and the social and economic dimensions of developing sustainable food systems. 

When I'm alone with free time, I like to read, dance, listen to music, do karaoke and run.
