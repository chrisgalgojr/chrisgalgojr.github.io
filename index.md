Hi, I am Christopher Jr. Galgo, an instructor at the Institute for Strategic Research and Development Studies at the Visayas State University. I am interested in the dynamics of the rural development process and the social and economic dimensions of developing food systems sustainable. 

In my spare time, I like to read, listen to music, do karaoke or run.
