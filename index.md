Hi, I'm a faculty member at the Institute for Strategic Research and Development Studies at the Visayas State University, The Philippines. I am interested in the role of data in rural development processes and the social and economic dimensions of developing sustainable food systems. 

In my spare time, I like to read, dance, listen to music, do karaoke or run.
