## Research
_**More than just food: Exploration of the diverse meanings ascribed to food by the different social groups in Eastern Visayas**_ (Jan 2022 - December 2022) with Ms. Gina Delima
* Project objectives

  The output and findings of this project are foreseen to assist in the improvement of the understanding of the contextual meaning of healthy food in the different social groups in Eastern Visayas (Region 8) and nearby provinces, thus, can inform policies and interventions geared toward the addressing food and nutrition issues in a more participatory and inclusive manner.
  
  Specifically, this study aims to:
1. provide an overview of the diverse meanings ascribed by the different social groups in Eastern Visayas region and nearby provinces to healthy and unhealthy food; 
2. examine the various factors that could facilitate and/or inhibit people from consuming healthy food as well as their future visions of healthy food systems; 
4. recommend a more inclusive food policy directions and strategies; and 
5. publish this research as a chapter in a book jointly written by researchers from more than 10 countries.

_**Assessing the resilience of the cocoa supply chain (The Philippines, 2019)**_

I spent about two months in Bohol and Davao Philippines collecting data for my MSc thesis. The goal of the project was to assess the resilience of the cocoa supply chain in the Philippines using supply chain resilience (SCR) elements as indicators of value chain actor's resilience in the context of developing countries. I collected household-level data using surveys and face to face interviews in major cocoa-producing areas in the country.

*Farmer’s interview for the case study on the agro-eco tourism development and sustainable farm resources uses in rural transition (Can Tho, Vietnam 2018)*

In 2018, I went to Vietnam to conduct a case study with the Mekong Delta Development Research Institute at Can Tho University as part of the IMRD program with support from VLIR-UOS. Together with researchers from the research institute and students from the master’s program, we conducted participatory rural appraisal exercises and interviews with local farmers (mostly orchard owners) to study how they contribute to agro-ecotourism development and rural transition in the Phong Dien District at Can Tho, Vietnam. 

_**Sweetpotato Industry Strategic Programme – Support Systems for Sweetpotato Value Chain Development and Establish SP Value Chains in Leyte (The Philippines, 2015-2017)**_

I worked as a science research assistant for this project where I was heavily involved in the field data collection through face to face interview and FGDs, data preparation and analysis for value chain analysis, project management support, and value chain capacity development which mainly involved linking farmers to support systems. We were able to assist 10 farmer associations, 1 cooperative and about 546 farmers in total in Leyte and Samar Leyte and Samar, Philippines.
