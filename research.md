#Cocoa supply chain resilience (The Philippines, 2019)

I spent about two months in Bohol and Davao Philippines collecting data for my MSc thesis. The goal of the project was to analyze the relationship of supply chain resilience elements in a developing country context using the Philippine cocoa supply chain as a case study. I collected household-level data using surveys and face to face interviews in major cocoa-producing areas in the country. 

#Agro-eco tourism development and Sustainable Farm Resources Uses in Rural Transition (Vietnam, 2018) 

In 2018, I went to Vietnam to conduct a case study with the Mekong Delta Development Research Institute at Can Tho University as part of the IMRD program with support from VLIR-UOS. Together with researchers from the research institute and students from the master’s program, we conducted participatory rural appraisal exercises and interviews with local farmers (mostly orchard owners) to study how they contribute to agro-ecotourism development and rural transition in the Phong Dien District at Can Tho, Vietnam. 

#Sweetpotato Industry Strategic Programme – Support Systems for Sweetpotato Value Chain Development and Establish SP Value Chains in Leyte (The Philippines, 2015-2017)

I worked as a science research assistant for this project where I was heavily involved in the field data collection through face to face interview and FGDs, data preparation and analysis for value chain analysis, project management support, and value chain capacity development which mainly involved linking farmers to support systems. We were able to assist 10 farmer associations and 1 cooperative and about 546 farmers in total in Leyte and Samar Leyte and Samar, Philippines.
