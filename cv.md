title: "Curriculum Vitae"
---

Interdisciplinary background in agribusiness and rural development economics. I have been involved in national research programmes and consultancy projects focused on value chain analyses/ development of major agricultural crops (seaweeds, sweetpotato, and rice) and the resilience of food systems in the Philippines. 

In these projects, I worked within multidisciplinary teams in collaboration with local civil society organizations, international NGOs, and government agencies to identify constraints, gaps, and opportunities within value chain segments and actors (farmers, farmer organisation beneficiaries, small-scale food processors, MSMEs) to upgrade products, processes, and chain performance.

As a faculty instructor for two years and six months, I was involved in instruction, research, and extension activities as a project leader and member of on-going extension and research projects.

I continuously seek to leverage my research skills and experience to contribute to research that aims to find solutions to key global transition issues in agriculture, education and the environment. It is my goal to contribute on solutions that aims to close the gap between the academia and communities in working towards a more sustainable future.
